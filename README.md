# ST parking lot | logger

This project was created with React, Nodejs, Express and MongoDB.

## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `cd client && npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `cd .. && node index.js`

This will start the backend nodejs server.
